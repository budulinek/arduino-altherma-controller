### Error codes from the Daikin P1P2 <---> UDP Gateway

 

| Error code | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00         | Connection error: No data received after timeout.            |
| 01         | Connection error: External controllers not supported by the unit.  Monitoring only. |
| 02         | Connection error: External controller already present, second one not  supported by the unit. Monitoring only. |
| 03         | Connection error: Two external controllers already present, third one not  supported by the unit. Monitoring only. |
| 04         | Connection error: Conflict with other external controller. Switching to  monitoring only. |
| 10         | Bus read error: Parity error detected.                       |
| 11         | Bus read error: Buffer overrun detected (overrun is after, not before,  the read byte). |
| 12         | Bus read error: CRC error detected in readpacket.            |
| 20         | Bus write error: Refusing to write packet while previous packet wasn't  finished. Try to adjust PACKET_30_DELAY or PACKET_3X_DELAY. |
| 21         | Bus write error: Refusing to write counter-request packet 0xB8 while  previous packet wasn't finished. Try to adjust PACKET_B8_DELAY. |
| 22         | Bus write error: Collision suspicion due to verification error in reading back written data. Try to adjust packet write delays. |
| 30         | Command error: Serial input line too long, interrupted or not EOL-terminated. |
| 31         | Command error: Empty line received.                          |
| 32         | Command error: Monitoring only, command dropped.             |
| 33         | Command error: Command for unknown packet type.              |
| 34         | Command error: Wrong command length.                         |
| 40         | Memory error: Not enough memory to store saved packets. Increase  HISTORY_SIZE or adjust savedPacketsRange[]. |
| 41         | Memory error: Busy, command queue full. Increase number of stored  commands COMMANDS_QUEUE. |
| 42         | Memory error: Busy, command queue full. Increase number of stored bytes  COMMANDS_QUEUE_BYTES. |
| FF         | Restart: Device restarted, possible power failure.           |

Please note that all these error codes are generated by Arduino, not the heat pump itself. For sure, the P1P2 protocol does report errors from the heat pump, somehow. But we were not able to identify and observe these errors. If you have a faulty unit reporting errors, your contribution is welcomed :-)
